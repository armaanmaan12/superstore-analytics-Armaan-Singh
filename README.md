CPSC Class Activity
Firstly, we worked in Google Colab and uploaded Sample - Superstore.csv. Our main task was to execute each code block.
The Key Insights
While the West region generates high sales volume, its profit margin is the lowest across all regions. This is primarily due to higher-than-average discounts on technology products, suggesting a need to reassess the discounting strategy in that area. 
Office Supplies, despite having lower sales than Technology, are the most consistently profitable category. Focusing on increasing the sales volume of high-margin office supplies could be a quick way to boost overall company profit.
Our learnings
This project served as a hands-on exercise in business intelligence, where we explored the Superstore sales dataset from two different analytical perspectives. Our main objective was to move beyond just numbers and uncover the underlying stories in the data related to regional sales patterns, category profitability, and product trends. To do this, we first used Python within a Google Colab notebook to perform a detailed, step-by-step analysis. Afterward, we used Microsoft Excel to recreate some of the key findings, which provided a valuable comparison of the two platforms. This report documents our process, the key business insights we discovered, and our personal reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of each tool for data analysis. This assignment really helped us understand how to use software like Google Colab and GitHub.
What was easier in Excel? What was harder?
Which tool gave more flexible or insightful analysis?
 
For us, excel is easier as we have been using excel since a very long time, so we have hands on it, but the challenging part of the excel is when it comes to creating charts and table, sometimes it can be confusing if the data is not clear. Meanwhile using google Colab is a new experience for us, and we find some difficulties in starting but later we realized that Google Colab is more user friendly and quick as we just need to run the code and it automatically comes up with all the data.
